The main Idea of this project is: Find ways for correcting non-SyntaxQ expressions to SyntaxQ expressions. 

As example: we have this string: `"Fold[Plus,a,{b,c,d,e}]". We can remove it one character from this string and get a `StringLength["Fold[Plus,a,{b,c,d,e}]"]` different strings. We can get it by

    inp = "Fold[Plus,a,{b,c,d,e}]";
    StringDrop[inp, {#}] & /@ Range[StringLength[inp]]



So, it will 22 different strings:

`old[Plus,a,{b,c,d,e}]
Fld[Plus,a,{b,c,d,e}]
...
Fold[Plus,a,{b,c,d,e]
Fold[Plus,a,{b,c,d,e}`

Some of them will give us `True` for function `SyntaxQ`. Let's try sort it by `Select`:

    dropped = StringDrop[inp, {#}] & /@ Range[StringLength[inp]]
    Select[dropped, Not[SyntaxQ[#]] &]

And we got only 4 results from 22:

`FoldPlus,a,{b,c,d,e}]
Fold[Plus,a,b,c,d,e}]
Fold[Plus,a,{b,c,d,e]
Fold[Plus,a,{b,c,d,e}
`

Let's try to evaluate it by function `ToExpression`.

    Map[ToExpression, Select[dropped, Not[SyntaxQ[#]] &]]

And we get list of errors:

`{$Failed, $Failed, $Failed, $Failed}`

It means that code are not correct, but it will be necessary to check `ToExpression` on not filtered list of strings:

    Map[ToExpression, dropped]

`{old[Plus,a,{b,c,d,e}]
Fld[Plus,a,{b,c,d,e}]
Fod[Plus,a,{b,c,d,e}]
Fol[Plus,a,{b,c,d,e}]
$Failed
lus[lus[lus[lus[a,b],c],d],e]
Pus[Pus[Pus[Pus[a,b],c],d],e]
Pls[Pls[Pls[Pls[a,b],c],d],e]
Plu[Plu[Plu[Plu[a,b],c],d],e]
Plusa[Plusa[Plusa[b,c],d],e]
b+c+d+e+Null
a b+a c+a d+a e
$Failed
a+c+d+e+Null
a+bc+d+e
a+b+d+e+Null
a+b+cd+e
a+b+c+e+Null
a+b+c+de
a+b+c+d+Null
$Failed
$Failed`

As we see, some of them were evaluated without any errors. It is normal because of `old, Fld, Fod, Fol, etc.,` counts as non defined functions. `Null` also counts as argument of function. It is the main reason of filtering the *dropped* list of strings.
